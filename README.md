__**Cosmos Discord Bot**__

**Description:** A general purpose Discord bot which aims to satisfy everyone's requirements and interests, from administration of their servers to fun commands (soon) for normal its normal members.

**Issue:** The voice XP is given to some user depends on amount of time they spent in voice chat. However, users who are sitting alone in voice chat or sitting in voice chat just with bots aren't ignored currently. This should be fixed and give XP to only those users who appear to be actually talking.

**Description:** A simple TODO web app built using Django Rest Framework as backend and ReactJS with Groummet for frontend.

### ~~__**Instant Notes**__~~ [Assigned]

**Description:** A minimal web application for taking notes, built using Python Flask, ReactJS and uses MongoDB.

**Issue:** Currently it stores passwords in plain text. Which is really bad practice. So it requires just a basic change which will store passwords using hashes along with salts. To make this process easier, werkzeug already comes up with a utility function for this: `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash` and `werkzeug.security.check_password_hash` which can be used here.

### ~~__**Image Processor**__~~ [Assigned]
**Description:** Image processor server is simple REST server made in Flask. Its task is really simple: to process the images on request and return the response.

**Issue:** There is a function which takes in an image or a GIF and write some texts and user's avatar over it. In case of GIF, this process is repeated on each GIF frame. But the issue is that, this causes the output GIF size to explode in range of 10-15MB. Any possible improvements to this are welcome which optimizes the resulting GIF or reduces its size.
