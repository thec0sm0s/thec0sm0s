## Hacktoberfest Issues

### __**TODOx**__
**Description:** A simple TODO web app built using Django Rest Framework as backend and ReactJS with Groummet for frontend.

**Feature Request:** The backend part is almost complete and doesn't needs much work. Even the ReactJS frontend part includes the Login and Signup flow. However, it is missing the actual component which will display the list of TODOs and allow one to create/delete/modify existing ones. And this main `todos.jsx` component needs to be included into it.

### __**Image Processor**__
**Description:** Image processor server is simple REST server made in Flask. Its task is really simple: to process the images on request and return the response.

**Issue:** There is a function which takes in an image or a GIF and write some texts and user's avatar over it. In case of GIF, this process is repeated on each GIF frame. But the issue is that, this causes the output GIF size to explode in range of 10-15MB. Any possible improvements to this are welcome which optimizes the resulting GIF or reduces its size.
